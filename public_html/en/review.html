				<h1><a name="stern">Seeing and Being</a></h1>
				<p>
					Stephen Corcoran, one of Jacques Rancière’s translators, describes as a particular regime everything accepted as contemporary thus: “systems or institutions of widespread prevalence that make it possible for certain things to appear as art”. Rancière characterises these certain things as “the arrangement of objects, photographs, the video apparatuses, the computers – and sometimes even the performances” of contemporary art1. He could have included all those site specific installations that come and go; he chose not to. Instead, and tellingly, he identifies those International Contemporary Art Practice creations and forms as “occupying the spaces on whose walls portraits were previously to be seen.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Why portraits in particular, not painting in general? It’s a question that didn’t occur to me until I first encountered the work of Jaeyeol Han. The paintings in his debut solo Irish outing let us glimpse a compelling answer to a question Rancière didn’t even realise he was asking. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Working with a restricted palette - the primaries plus black and white - making the most of the tension between the descriptive and the abstract, Han’s small canvases, his 1:1 scale, convey the dynamic vulnerability and vitality of his subjects to compelling effect. The faces he presents, his cast of characters, are figures glimpsed in passing. His adept use of his material, painting sticks, makes for an assured balance of concept and craft. Sheets of grey, shifting planes of colour - the same colour working its way through an image as contour, mass, shade or light and the greys always richly coloured. His grasp of portraiture’s complex surfaces and volumes, his confident engagement with both his material and subject matter sees him deliver portraits for the fast paced, splintered reality of contemporary life. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Han’s work makes us viscerally alert to the double nature of the glimpse; he visible and the temporal as a short duration co-presence. Their conjunction might be thought of as a cusp moment, an everyday moment that only rarely becomes pivotal, this is Han’s achievement. His paintings resist being characterised as studies; or sketches, so powerfully does he evoke the poignancy of lives lived, hinted at, either side of the brief moment when their glimpsed presence is set down by Jaeyeol Han. These are fully achieved art works and they stand as a direct challenge to ICAP’s abstracted, conceptualised, reduced to an issue, a theme, I refer to Identity, usually figured as an isolated statistic.
				</p>
				<p>
					We tend to forget Postmodernism, its one-time preoccupation with the gaze, then the glance. These fell aside, almost overnight, as International Contemporary Art Practice became installed as the new regime round the turn of the century. Han’s paintings constitute a critique of ICAP from within this new regime. Its preoccupations, themes and concerns – politics, consumerism, gender issues, et al – all address as broadly an imagined, an abstracted, audience as its abstracted conceptualisations allow. Under such conditions the reality of the actual individual is overlooked.
				</p>
				<p>
					The portraits of Colin Davidson, Chuck Close or Braco Dimitrijević are a case in point. There’s always something monstrous about oversized heads; IACP compliant, they play to the notion of the spectacle. And in this instance it’s a presentation of the visible that trivialises, glosses over the lived specificity of the individual. It’s a take on Identity as an issue which addresses no-one by addressing everyone in the abstract. The person represented becomes a datum, a cipher relevant only within some demographic or other presided over by IACP – politics, consumerism, celebrity; whatever. Perhaps this explains what Rancière had in mind when he identified portraits alone as signalling what has been replaced by IACP’s things. Having revived to brilliant effect the implications of the gaze and glance, having developed these into the glimpse, Han reinstates the notion of the individual as a viable presence. He also challenges Rancière’s diagnosis; portraiture remains firmly within the ICAP continuum.

				<h1><a name="glass">Jaeyeol Han’s Probe Heads</a></h1>
				<h2>Portraits for the 21St Century</h2>
				<p>
					The paintings Jaeyeol Han created for his Dublin exhibitions are unassumingly small, each measuring about 30 by 25 cm. On each canvas a single human head is depicted. Han insists on identifying these as his faces. Each head / face is close to life size and ranged to the right of the canvas surface; on the left hand side can be seen the holes indicating that these paintings could easily be held together within the covers of a ring-binder - none of the above accounts for why these paintings, to borrow an expression, punch above their weight. These face / heads all stand out against the stark white of primed canvas. They are not embedded within a painted matrix that would provide some pictorial context or other. This lends each head a sculptural quality – Han’s grasp of form is adroitly displayed throughout. Each painting stages the conflict between abstraction and description, tensions held in dynamic balance. These forces are not glossed over, suppressed beneath a slick technical finish; their visibility announces that these are not paintings for the bourgeois drawing-room. Han has greater ambitions.
				</p>
				<p>
					*
				</p>
				<p>
					On learning that Mr. Han is due to return to Korea in a few weeks time I reread my diary entry above, dated 17/02/2012 and arranged to view the work he has created since February. Arrayed along the walls of his impromptu studio these new paintings were evidence of a fast paced evolution and development. His colour range is no longer limited to the primaries as reported in Felix Sterne’s brief essay, Seeing and Being1. And my suspicion that Han is prolifically productive was confirmed when he showed me two full ring-binders. These contained work the artist had yet to decide to include within his oeuvre. And it took a small deception on my part to gain access to their contents. In all there were close on three hundred paintings and all were consistent with Sterne’s observation, “the poignancy of lives lived, hinted at, either side of the brief moment when their glimpsed presence is set down by Jaeyeol Han.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Sterne’s insight can be expanded upon when viewed within the broader framework provided by the philosopher Gilles Delueze - (see O’Sulliavan, endnote 2). The latter’s probe-head theory, one of an interrelated constellation of concepts, speaks eloquently to Jaeyeol Han’s paintings. For Delueze the probe-head represents an occasion of resistance to the received wisdom - of politicians, of the mass media - telling us how we should view the world. As such probe-heads turn aside, in both directions from the present as we are tacitly instructed to accept it. This turning aside, to the past and the future, can be understood as the constant creative renewal of our own subjectivity, the search for and the production of our own individuality.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thinking through Sterne’s insight into Han’s paintings - the Jaeyeol Han effect, if you will – and its parallel trajectory with Delueze’s probe heads raises a question I haven’t toyed with for years: Why is the probe-head concept excluded from Delueze’s magnificent volume, Francis Bacon, the logic of sensation? On one level the question is, of course, absurd; writers, particularly speculative writers are not to be taken to task for what they leave unsaid. My question nonetheless becomes admissible if, rephrased, it becomes: why are Bacon’s portraits by Delueze from consideration as probe-heads? And I believe a brief excursus to explore this will point up the value of Han’s achievement.
				</p>
				<p>
					As is well known Bacon worked from photographs and memory to produce his portraits. In contrast here’s Han’s working method, "From quick daytime sketches each painting is worked to completion in a single intense session after dark." These differences are heightened when we recall that Bacon’s portraits all evince paint being allowed to dry before the application of subsequent additions. These temporal/procedural distinctions, otherwise banal, take on a particular significance in relation to Delueze’s probe-head concept. Bacon’s other great champion, David Sylvester, in his final farewell, Looking back at Francis Bacon3, offers a telling insight. In an extraordinary ‘as if’ gesture Sylvester describes the Bacon’s portraits as comparable to the experience of our initial encounter with a person; of becoming acquainted with their movements, facial expressions, their gestures, their conversational animation. You will recall Bacon was a very social animal. Exiting this excursus consider also the procedural/temporal element in the work of the late Lucian Freud whose sitters posed repeatedly for hours on end over periods of months, of years. At issue here is the time frame implicated, embedded in the artwork, not the production time of paintings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Looking again at Han’s paintings, a small few brought over from Korea, others made in Haiti, Paris, and London, most created here in Dublin; looking around me, thinking through the evidence of Sterne’s conception of the glimpse, “The visible and the temporal as a short duration co-presence”- calls to mind the strange temporality of probe-heads, to quote O’Sullivan. Caught in the matrix of arts affective power I am reminded too of the partial object nature of the art work, of its completion by/in the viewer. Our interaction with art has then the character of an event – Art invokes its own audience, calls a people, an audience into being, as Delueze might have said. “The lives lived, hinted at either side of the brief moment when their glimpsed presence is set down by Han.”- the shudder between past and future overcoming the present to actualise other temporalities, other possibilities of life. Hans work posits a real that is yet to come, a new type of reality.
				</p>
				<p>
					My copy of The Life of Forms in Art4 has Henri Focillion make the following proposal; the chief characteristic of the mind is to be constantly describing itself. Han’s ongoing project, his faces/heads, his probe-heads and the work of his predecessors provide evidence that the arts are the best available tool for this task. Han’s discovery of the glimpse as a visual correlate for the time of probe-heads identifies his work as testimony to the fact that the chief characteristic of the mind is to be constantly creating new ways to describe itself.

				<div>
					<blockquote>

							Art thickens the texture of life.

				</div>
				<p>
					I recall the surprise and delight of the experience on seeing the paintings of Jaeyeol Han for the first time and I recall too a mounting sense of confusion on leaving the venue. Rambling along Dublin's Dawson’s Street, stopping at the Apollo Gallery to collect my thoughts, I found myself facing an unexpectedly small, an unconvincingly authentic Sean Scully canvas and the thought occurred to me: either Han's work should not have been part of that exhibition or his should have been the only work shown! Han's paintings had unsettled me, they excited me. And that warm August afternoon I was at a loss to know just why they excited me and I was intrigued.
				</p>
				<p>
					I ran into him again a month later by which time we had already begun exchanging emails. He had accepted my offer to edit his statement and we met to discuss it over coffee. Jaeyeol's English is remarkable for the breath of his vocabulary; grammar and syntax to be worked on. At 6'4" he cuts a dash, has a bright well informed inquiring mind and a ready wit. Our conversations introduced me to the reciprocal r/ l slippages of English spoken with an Asian accent - and the misunderstandings these can spawn. And Jae wasn't beyond deliberately engaging this peculiarity, for its comic effect, over the months ahead - he was always good company. Circumspect regarding his private life he was at all times polite in the manner that strikes westerners as uniquely Asian. If we think of him as a product of his culture then perhaps these two go hand in hand. But what marks him as a man is his determination as an artist. Jaeyeol wasn't spending a year abroad for the fun of it; he wasn't on a bazz, goofing off, his Irish residency was dedicated to the development of his faces project - this interim title underwent a number of variations as his project evolved.
				</p>
				<p>
					Enough for now about the artist; one of the first things that struck me the previous month was how, despite the fact that each painting was a stand alone work; it felt they exercised something like a gravitational pull on each other. Stylistic continuities aside either they belonged together in some way I couldn’t put my finger on or they yearned to be together, creating their own community. I'll return to this later, for now lets set some parameters for considering his paintings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Han counts the influence of Goethe's Theory of Colour as primary - he was reading its Korean translation when we first met, not that that matters. He deploys rich saturated colours against which his use of black as a colour, as a component of outline, as a means of establishing detail - both directly and obliquely - and, of course, as shadow; his use of black provides an amateur lending his images solidity. It’s the solidity of the emphatic, it is never static. With few exceptions his subjects - on each of his canvases a single head is captured - his subjects are taken from the street, from coffee shops; passers-by all; all of them realized in a dynamic interplay of depiction and abstraction.
				</p>
				<p>
					At Art's remove his knowledge of the physiognomical variability of faces and of the head's anatomy, sees him produce strikingly distinctive avatars of his subjects. These originate in a sketchbook he adds to assiduously, daily. From such outings he selects those pieces which have, for him, a particular resonance. And in the dead of night and in single intense sessions he creates his paintings - did I remark before his concentration and its reach? I am reminded too of his equally fierce independence of mind. My bad: Jaeyeol has an extensive vocabulary, check: he concentrates, attends closely to what is being said, check. On my side there were times when mother tongue fluency expressing some thought or other, followed by the assumption that it has been internalised - translated, digested and agreed with and my too hasty assumption of the reign of concord. Stop. When he had reason to differ with what I had just said he wasn’t reticent in doing so insistently. On such occasions his fluency, strangely, was a match for mine! These occasions added spice, piquancy to our conversations over coffee, our in- gallery exchanges, our post-exhibition debates and dissections over lunch. This insistent independence finds further expression in his work.
				</p>
				<p>
					Going back to the canvases I could write a few lines regarding the light within these paintings; their harmonies, the modulations of his colours - hue over tone; I could speak to their internal unconstrained variety; I could touch on the textures he achieves with oilbars, his chosen medium, its impastos and transparencies but what struck me as particularly apposite, perhaps fortuitously so was the 1:1 scale of his renditions of what it is to be human. I continue to resist the application of holistic - the philosophical concept - to Han's paintings - while not inappropriate it strikes me as inadequate. Formal analysis tells us what is already self-evident, it points to what is note-worthy but is inadequate when it comes to addressing what we see and its impact, just what has been brought into existence for our consideration; what discreet corner of our being has it touched?
				</p>
				<p>
					Before retuning to this there were other threads to tie up in my attempt to think his paintings. I needed to stand back, find a broader context within which to test why Han's paintings of passers-by exceed the category of the sketch or study. I was also curious as to what would happen when, on his return to Korea, Jaeyeol began making substantially larger paintings of his chosen subject. And I am pleased to report the concern expressed therein regarding his large paintings evaporated on seeing the first of these. Returning to my subject, reminding myself that first and foremost Han's faces are paintings - his is the pursuit of painting practiced as an Art - its worth reflecting on the artist's aesthetic, this time in his own words. The quote cited below is taken from an introduction he's recently written. It's a bold statement of intent, of what is at stake in the paintings of Jaeyeol Han.
				</p>
				<p>
					“It is the job of the artist to pay close attention to things, to give them the attention they deserve. This series of paintings shows a distinction about the power of existence when complete strangers become objects of interest to me.”
				</p>
				<p>
					And a brief biographical note may provide a telling insight into his choice of subject. In conversation he related the rigors of his education, both his schooling and the long hours of home study. He also spoke of the loneliness experienced by the only child. If the former provided a solid background for the discipline required by Art the latter may well have set in motion his keen interest in the singularity, in the specificity of other people. This may also account for the ethical dimension Sterne senses in his work. And a further insight is provided by his artist's statement, quoted below. In this extract, having already made clear his use of the concept 'sentiment' is to be understood in the context of Asian philosophy - it denotes balance, moderation - he begins:
				</p>
				<p>
					Sentiment, as autonomous judgment; holding within its embrace both feeling and reason's analytical drive. In other words the act of painting, for me, is a process of making decisions guided by emotional impulses which are, ironically, based on reason's observations, its judgments and conclusions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The outcome of this process results in paintings, visually rich surfaces in which the exact nature of these forces - feeling / reason - is held in dynamic tension. And it is this holding of opposing forces in free, open play that provides the connectivity between my paintings and their audience.
				</p>
				<p>
					This gives us a broader understanding of his practice as an artist. And its last sentence, “. . . opposing forces in free, open play that provides the connectivity . . .” signals a reminder of the gravitational pull I mentioned at the start of this meditation on Han's work. The affinity I sensed between his subjects extends to include the spectators witnessing their presence. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Han’s faces are so empathically established on his canvases they can be described as sculptural. Occasional lightly applied lines, mere markers – remnants of the blocking in stage – remain visible; unaltered they cradle his heads. This heightens and breathes life into the sculptural effect; they have created a space for themselves against what would otherwise register simply as primed canvas. But it would be wrong to say the surrounding primed canvas entirely isolates. As a moderating force counterpoised to the paint out of which his heads are created it functions to provide space within which they have the option of movement. It registers through the paint film too; on occasion as the absence of paint, elsewhere seeping through the colour / stain of glazes. They carry a certain frission, an undercurrent of expressive potential; their intervals are charged. In formal terms these lend his images a degree of transparency. Beyond the limits of so narrow a view it’s a transparency experienced as permeability. Formal analysis has the option of deploying Gestalt psychology to explain how this or that hiatus, rift or pause in the paint surface evades surface consciousness, evades our everyday perceptions. Yet it has little to offer in response to how these discontinuities and pauses conspire to coalesce into the sensation of permeability, a permiability rejecting see-through transparency in favour of a sence of absorption. The force drawing Han's subjects together beckons to the viewer of his work.
				</p>
				<p>
					Contemplating these lacunas, these transparencies and, at the time, drafting a note for the interview I plan conducting with the artist it occurred to me that to view his work is to place ourselves in the position of one or another of his passers-by. On our daily round we are all someone or other coming and going; we may recognise a small few of the passers-by accompanying us on our way but we all partake in a wider anonymity. This is the community we are drawn into by the players of Han’s faces series.

				<h1><a name="hong">Savagery – Reading His Veracious Vernacular</a></h1>

				Jaeyeol Han Opens Out / 
				Solo Exhibition at Gahoedong 60 / 
				June 12 – June 25, 2013

				<br><br>
				<p>
					His paintings are crude and coarse. Words of embellishment and supplement are not allowed for these images. They are primitive, like an enormous molecule shrinking for an instant only to explode immediately, escaping the conventional mold in which paintings are often casted in, and approaching us as a conglomerate of chaotic and unidentifiable energy. His main subject is rumination of his own memory, specifically the nameless strangers perambulating amongst. 
				</p>
				<p>
					These are his words. “There are just as many ways of seeing and understanding as the number of humans in this world. Likewise, I paint to express my personal and subjective response to each object.”  
				</p>
				<p>
					Under formal analysis, his portraits traverse the figurative and the abstract. His works are formed from instinct, not with underlying calculations. Contrary to his statement, “I add logic and judgment to the mixture of reason and sentiment”, his paintings are, in fact, rather marks of an upheaval - what Carl Gustav Jung had often referred to as primitive image – during which the subconscious manifests. His artworks accentuate feverous subconscious rather than cold logic, and therefore the process of “capturing none but the dynamic tension between emotion and reason” is rooted in primordial intuition yet to become coherent thoughts. His argument, “the outcome of this process is a visually rich surface, painting”, is finally completed. The result, what we witness, is his veracious vernacular.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jaeyeol Han received Bachelor of Fine Arts from Suwon University, and has since held two solo exhibits including the latest one at Gahoedong 60. He also participated in a number of group exhibits, receiving Award of Excellence from Seoul Digital University earlier this year in March.

				<p>


Sometimes, while walking through the crowded streets of a large city, it can be easy to forget that the people we pass are also going somewhere, meeting someone, or hoping for something. Those people are also ervous, happy, anxious and sad. We walk by each other thinking little of the other pedestrians, hardly seeing their aces, rarely wondering where they are going or who they are. We often just focus on ourselves. Artist Han Jae Yeol, however, pays attention to the passers-by and has introduced us to them in his paintings. “During my military service, I was dispatched to Haiti’s peacekeeping unit in response to the earthquakes.” Han said, “what was happening there was contained in {the Haitians} faces.” 
</p>
				<p>
He continued, “I collected those faces and that’s how it began.”
</p>
				<p>
Though we are many, we are also individuals. Han hasn’t forgotten the importance and beauty of individuality. “A Crowd of humans flowing like a body of water,” Han says in his blog “negates individual energy and dissolves their existence.” Walking amongst a group of people makes us less likely to focus on any one individual. While Han walks amongst a crowd of people, he often begins retreating further into himself. His work is a response to that inward focus. Since his service in Haiti, he has turned his energy outward and created his project; a collection that encompasses over 300 paintings. Han believes that artists must “pay close attention to things, to give them the attention they deserve.” Han gives consideration to the “existential energy” of the people he observes and looks to capture its presence with oil paints. “I was first interested in the structural qualities of the human face,” Han said, “but later realized that this interest rose from a primitive force exerted from faces.” He decided to work with paint despite it being a traditional medium. Painting, Han feels, is the best way “to capture brief existences born between image and spontaneity.”
</p>
				<p>
Han’s work doesn’t show details of the subject’s face. The final outcome looks similar to what we may remember when trying to recall a face with which we are not familiar. Han’s portraits are blurred with color expressing the “existential energy” he sees in a person’s face. Han reveals the subject’s emotions and energy with the colors that he chooses to use.
</p>
				<p>
His work also speaks of a larger societal issue. “We avoid human relations,” Han said, “our lifecycles change to make living alone more comfortable and convenient.”
</p>
				<p>
He believes living too much within ourselves isn’t healthy, and we must communicate with others more often. “The age of excluding the others is over, but now the self exhausts the self, and violence is returned into the self.” Han’s work looks to expose this idea of the self, and to give us an experience with the faces we rarely take the time to examine. His paintings remind us that sometimes you should take a closer look at the people around you. The discoveries you can make with this simple act may surprise you.
